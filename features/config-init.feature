Feature: Config init
  In order to use proctor
  As a user
  I need to be able to create a config file

  Scenario: Creation of default config
    When I run "proctor config:init"
    Then it should pass with:
    """
    Created ~/.proctor.yml
    """
    And "~/.proctor.yml" should contain:
    """
    # MySQL/MariaDB credentials for creating test site databases.
    mysql:
      host: localhost
      user: username
      pass: pass
    # Path to selenium-server jar.
    selenium-server: ""
    # Allows you to override the command lines used for external commands.
    # commands:
    #   drush: ""
    #   mysql: ""
    #   java: ""
    # This allows for mapping site names to database names. The first matching
    # pattern will be used.
    # database-mapping:
    #     "/^([^.]+).([^.]+).([^.]+)$/": "$2_$1"
    """
    
  Scenario: Should not overwrite existing config file
    Given "~/.proctor.yml" contains:
    """
    stuff
    """
    When I run "proctor config:init"
    Then the output should contain:
    """
    ~/.proctor.yml already exists
    """
    And "~/.proctor.yml" should contain:
    """
    stuff
    """
